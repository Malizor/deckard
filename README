Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10.


DEPENDENCIES
============

You will need the following packages:

libgtk-3-bin
python3-gi
python3-jinja2
libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3

On Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 you can get a Broadway enabled GTK+ with this PPA:
https://launchpad.net/~malizor/+archive/gtk-broadway

You may want to use the latest version of GTK+ if your interfaces depend on new
widgets.


INSTALLATION
============

Here is how to set up the Deckard site.
It will be ran as a specific user to secure things a bit.

- Create a user named 'deckard' and it's home directory
sudo useradd deckard --create-home

- Copy the source folder content in /home/deckard
  Of course, all files should belong to the 'deckard' user.
  
- Copy vhost/apache2/deckard in /etc/apaches/sites-available
  (you probably want to change ServerAdmin and ServerName before)
  
- enable the the site and restart Apache
sudo a2ensite deckard && sudo service apache restart

And that's it :-)

Now you just have to generate the content that will be displayed.


CONTENT
=======

The Deckard app will look for a "content" folder in it's root.
It must have a specific layout. Here is a sample tree of it:

content/
├── module1
│   └── ....
├── module2
│   └── ....
└── LANGS
    ├── fr_FR
    │   └── LC_MESSAGES
    │       ├── module1.mo
    │       └── module2.mo
    └── es_ES
        └── LC_MESSAGES
            ├── module1.mo
            └── module2.mo

The LANGS tree should not surprise you if you are familiar with Gettext.
The organisation of files in modules folders is up to you.

"build-content.sh" is the script that is used on deckard.malizor.org to
automatically generate the content folder. You may want to reuse or to adapt it.


FAQ
===

My windows are ugly!
--------------------

You may want to install this package:
gnome-themes-standard

If still no theme is applied to your windows, you can edit
~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
and add the following lines:

[Settings]
gtk-theme-name = Adwaita
gtk-fallback-icon-theme = gnome

Some locales don't work!
------------------------

Please run:
locale -a

If your locale is not in the list, then you need to enable it.
On Ubuntu systems, you need to add your locale in
/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
Then you have to run:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

I found a bug/I have an idea!
