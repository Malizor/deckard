- Add more locales! (there are 177 on http://l10n.gnome.org/languages)

- Support locales with an '@'

- Do not consider all uploaded PO files as English.
   Currently, it is not possible to specify for which locale is an
   uploaded PO file and English is used by default. This means UI are
   not reverted when they should (RTL locales) and Gtk buttons appear
   in English. An uploaded PO file should be "attached" to the
   currently selected locale. 

- Web design improvements (eg. selectors should not take so much
   vertical space)

- Dynamically patch the Broadway Javascript code to change the window placement
   algorithm in order to provide a kind of tilling view (some previews
   like Zenity open many windows which are currently one on top of the
   other). This could lead to upstreamable (Gtk+) patches.

- Provide a configuration file to easily change things like the content
   folder location, the max sessions number, PO urls... This would
   allow Deckard to be more flexible and less bound to Gnome (no one
   want to edit the source code to change the default configuration).

- Rewrite "build-content.sh" in Python, make it more flexible and
   useful for other projects than Gnome (eg. LibreOffice).

- Propose gladerunner.py for upstreaming in the Glade project (to
   replace or to extend glade-previewer)

- Make Deckard translatable
