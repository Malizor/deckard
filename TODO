- Add more locales! (there are 177 on http://l10n.gnome.org/languages)

- Support locales with an '@'

- Do not consider all uploaded PO files as English.
   Currently, it is not possible to specify for which locale is an
   uploaded PO file and English is used by default. This means UI are
   not reverted when they should (RTL locales) and Gtk buttons appear
   in English. An uploaded PO file should be "attached" to the
   currently selected locale. 

- Web design improvements (eg. selectors should not take so much
   vertical space)

- Dynamically patch the Broadway Javascript code to solve
   problems like "no scrolling possible when the pointer is on the
   iframe". And it would also be cool to change the window placement
   algorithm to provide a kind of tilling view (some previews like Zenity
   open many windows which are currently one on top of the
   other). This could lead to upstreamable (Gtk+) patches.

- Provide a configuration file to easily change things like the content
   folder location, the max sessions number, PO urls... This would
   allow Deckard to be more flexible (no one want to edit the source
   code to change the default configuration).

- Split the "locale_language_mapping" dict from libdeckard into a
   dedicated Python file/module

- rewrite "build-content.sh" in Python, make it more flexible and
   useful for other projects than Gnome.

- Make Deckard translatable
