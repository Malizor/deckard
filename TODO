- Add more locales! (there are 177 on http://l10n.gnome.org/languages)

- Web design improvements (eg. selectors should not take so much
   vertical space)

- Dynamically patch the Broadway Javascript code to solve
   problems like "no scrolling possible when the pointer is on the
   iframe". And it would also be cool to change the window placement
   algorithm to provide a kind of tilling view (some previews like Zenity
   open many windows which are currently one on top of the other)

- Provide a configuration file to easily change things like the content
   folder location, the max sessions number, PO urls...

- Split the "locale_language_mapping" dict from libdeckard into a
   dedicated Python file/module

- rewrite "build-content.sh" in Python
