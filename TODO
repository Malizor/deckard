- Add more locales! (there are 177 on http://l10n.gnome.org/languages)

- Support locales with an '@'

- Web design improvements (eg. selectors should not take so much
   vertical space)

- Dynamically patch the Broadway Javascript code to change the window placement
   algorithm in order to provide a kind of tilling view (some previews
   like Zenity open many windows which are currently one on top of the
   other). This could lead to upstreamable (Gtk+) patches.

- Provide a user documentation in the Web interface
   advertise, for example, the use of http parameters

- Cache the result of the get_diplayable_content() function

- Propose gladerunner.py for upstreaming in the Glade project (to
   replace or to extend glade-previewer)

- Make Deckard translatable
